# Titanic_classification
This Titanic classification project aims to predict survival based on various attributes of passengers aboard the Titanic. 
Attributes: Gender, Passenger Class (Pclass), Embarkation Point (Embarked), Survival Status


Implemented three different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Evaluated each model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Accuracy achieved through models:**
Logistic Regression: 78%.
Random Forest: 79%.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: 81%(better performance).
The Gradient Boosting Classifier outperformed both Logistic Regression and Random Forest in terms of accuracy.
